# Password-Generator

Created javascript to generate a random password when the button is clicked.

The user will receive prompts asking how many characters they want between 8 - 128.

If the user doesn't select a number within the range, they will receive a prompt stating an error and for them to select again.

After they select a number length within the range, they will then be asked questions concerning if they want lowercase, uppercase, number, and special characters in their random password.

They will also receive confirmation prompts stating that they did or did not want a certain character choice in their password.

If the user selects that they don't want any of the character choices in their password, they will receive a prompt stating that there is an error, and for them to select at least one character choice.

After the user is finished selecting character choices, a random password will generate with the amount of numbers they choose and the character choices they choose.
